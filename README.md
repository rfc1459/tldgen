This programs generates an header file for [Azzurra IRC Services](http://devel.azzurra.org/services)
with a Deterministic Finite Automaton for Top-Level Domain validation.

Requirements:

 * [Python](http://www.python.org/) 2.5 or higher
 * [IANA TLD plain text list](http://data.iana.org/TLD/tlds-alpha-by-domain.txt)

This is mostly for internal use by Azzurra IRC Network, but if you find it
useful feel free to fork it and adapt to your needs.

Likewise, if you have any suggestion just open an issue ;-)
